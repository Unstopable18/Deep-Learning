There are several types of activation functions that are popularly used in neural networks, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of the most commonly used activation functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sigmoid Function: The sigmoid function maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1. It is used to model the probability of a binary output or the probability of a neuron being activated. The sigmoid function is given by:\n",
    "$f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^-x)$\n",

    "where x is the input to the function. The main disadvantage of the sigmoid function is that it suffers from the vanishing gradient problem, which can slow down the learning process.\n",

However, it suffers from a problem called \"dying ReLU,\" where the neuron can get stuck in a state where its output is always 0, resulting in a dead neuron that does not contribute to the network's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Leaky ReLU Function: The Leaky ReLU function is a modification of the ReLU function that addresses the dying ReLU problem. It adds a small, non-zero slope to the negative part of the function, which allows the neuron to recover from the dead state. The Leaky ReLU function is given by:\n",
    "$f(x) = max(ax, x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where a is a small positive constant (e.g., 0.01).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Softmax Function: The Softmax function is used in multi-class classification problems, where the output of the network is a probability distribution over several classes. The Softmax function maps a vector of real numbers to a probability distribution, where the sum of the probabilities is equal to 1. The Softmax function is given by:\n",

    "where x_i is the i-th element of the input vector, and j ranges over all the elements of the vector.\n",
